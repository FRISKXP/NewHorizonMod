description: "Expanded contents, including Units, Turrets, Blocks, etc.\n\n\t[lightgray]I am sorry to all phone players because I actually have some HARDWARE problem, which causes  stuck problem when load content on phones. I can't solve this problem, so in order to save the phone players, the only thing I can do is cut the load code off when the mod is run on phone. And that lead to some sprite problem: [accent]no unit outline textures and full unit icons[]. Again, sorry about that."
