However, the advanced loading now causes a stuck problem when the game is loaded on a phone. So, for your gaming experience, I made it false by default. If you are confident with your device, activate it. If you find that your device cannot afford it, open the mod file folder and find the 'new-horizon' folder, open the properties file in it, and rewrite the '@active.advance-load' to false, then open the game again.[]"
