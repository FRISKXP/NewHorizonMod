# NEWHORIZON MOD

![Logo](assets/sprites-override/ui/logo.png)

****A Java Mindustry mod that works on Android and PC.****

**Powered by *Yuria*.**

## Cautions
**DOES NOT SUPPORT _IOS_**

Require install `jdk 14` or maybe jdk in other versions(at least 8).

Unzip the Mod.zip file first or download from _Release_, then install the mod in game;

Mod is ***unstable***(mainly for phones, which are some UI and load problems) and ***WIP***.

All codes are here, and no *safety* problems.

## In Game Settings
This mod adds a new setting dialog when start the game.
By choose the available setting, you can activate in-game debug panel and advance load, which creates outline icons and unit full icons automatically.
However, the advance load now causes stuck problem when the game is loaded on a phone. So for your gaming experience, I made it defaults false. If you are confident with your device, active it.
If you find your device cannot afford it, open the mod file folder and find the "new-horizon" folder then open the properties file in it, and then rewrite the "@active.advance-load*" to false, then open the game again.

**However, when the mod is deleted, the setting file wouldn't be deleted automatically, so before I solve this problem, you may have to delete it by yourself.**
